A place to collect useful resources for the late Zeepro Zim 3D printer

The company Zeepro collapsed in the summer of 2015 following a severe car accident in which the CEO was critically injured.  The backers of their Kickstarter project are maintaining support on the Zeepro forum on technobly for one another.

The current goal for those trying to get a little life out of their Zim printers after the end of 2015 (when most of the remaining cloud-connected software from the Zim will cease functioning) is to divorce the hardware from Zeepro's proprietary software.

Zim users needed a place to centrally share useful resources.  Here it is.
