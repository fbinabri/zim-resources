# Zeepro Support Site Backup

This is a backup of the support documents on Zeepro's FreshDesk support system.  

The image links now point to local files, so the support pages can even be used without a network connection, starting with [home.html] (home.html).

You can't view it as a Web page from GitHub. If you don't use Git you'll need to [download the zim-resources repository] (https://github.com/zeepro-zim/zim-resources/archive/master.zip) as a ZIP file.  When you expand that, go into the folder and then into the `support-docs` folder and double-click on [`home.html`] (home.html) to view it in your browser as usual.

If you do use git you probably know how to clone the repository using the [clone URL] (https://github.com/zeepro-zim/zim-resources) for the same result.
